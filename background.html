<h2> <p> <p style="color:brown"> Significance of the Project Background of the Project</h2>


<h3> <p> <p style="color:red"> A. Why is the project important for the institution?
  </p> </h3>

<h5> <p> <u>The project is important for the institution because it will provide them with some ideas for how to solve the problem that they are currently experiencing. According to the Ustad, there are many problems that they are currently dealing with, such as flooding and a lack of funds, which is why this project is important for the institution because it can help them solve the problems they are currently dealing with.
  </p> </u></h5> <br>
  <br>


<h3> <p> <p style="color:red">  B. Why is the project important for the Ateneo Students?
 </p> </h3>

<h5> <p> <u> Because it applies the Ignatian values taught in school, the project we proposed can benefit Ateneo students. We are taught as Ateneans to be Men and Women for Others, Cura Personalis, and Magis. We do our best to help the community and the environment while keeping the people in the institution in mind. Caring for them and their health implies that men and women are responsible for others. We also find God in our actions as we propose this project. It teaches us to love others in the face of adversity. We love by assisting others.
 </p> </u></h5> <br>
 <br>


<h3> <p> <p style="color:red">  C. Why is the project important for the public in general? </p> </h3>

<h5> <p> <u> The project is important for the general public in order to raise awareness about the Madrasah's issues and other communities that face similar issues. As you can see, by doing our best to promote the partner institution, it gains more traction from future benefactors and volunteers who want to make a difference in the community by participating in our Community drive where we provide cleaning materials in order to reduce waste in their area and solve the Madrasah's problems. As a result, we are able to not only directly assist the Madrasah, but also to instill in others the Atenean values of being Men and Women for Others, as well as to help others understand the difficult situations of communities similar to our Partner Institution.

<h3> <p> <p style="color:blue"> Rationale: </h3>
<h5> <p> <u> The proposed project is extremely essential and suitable for the issue the community is facing, as it helps guide beneficiaries in spreading awareness, preparing for and recovering from floods, and providing them with the necessary materials. such as metal screens, recycling bins, and tree saplings or seeds for our tree planting activity along with our clean-up drive. and also by educating residents on important safety precautions and assisting in the repair of damaged materials. Our project contributes to taking action to create safety and prevent further damage from flooding. Due to our project implementation, future benefactors and volunteers will be able to be more aware of other issues the community is facing and also purchase materials and aid for those issues too, like the learning environment of students and the lack of school materials.<br>

<h2> <p> <p style="color:blackblue"> 	BACKGROUND of the PROJECT</h2>

<h3> <p> <p style="color:blue"> Statement: </h3>
<h5> <p> <u> The Ustad had indicated that their institution is having issues in their locations, such as floods, therefore the Madrasah is currently dealing with an environmental issue. I'm afraid to say that these issues will harm us because they will have an impact on our environment and health but as we can see, we can't just sit back and wait for this issue to worsen, so we made the decision to do something about it for the benefit of everyone, like organize a cleanliness drive in their neighborhood and by carrying out a project that incorporates the 4Rs and more. So by carrying out a project of this nature, we will be able to assist everyone in reducing the issue that their community is currently experiencing.
</u> <br>
</h5>


<h3> <p> <P style="color:blue"> Description: </h3>
<h5> <p> <u> The detrimental repercussions of the Madrasah institution's mismanaged garbage are its main issue. From the interview, we've seen, as you can see, Sir. It has reportedly caused flooding near the Madrasah, according to Lupon (?). This interferes with both pupils and staff's regular school activities. Due to factors including insufficient classroom space, scheduling conflicts, and damaged supplies, more money is spent on these issues than on the instruction the kids are receiving. The Madrasah needs support, and we want to do everything we can to help them acquire it. We also want to help them carry out their future plans. Due to this, we are able to plan suggestions for solutions that will help our partner community, enhance their environment, and improve the condition of the Madrasah. 
</u> <br>
</h5>


<h3> <p> <p style="color:blue"> Summary: </h3>
<h5> <p> <u> The goal of this initiative is to teach everyone about the consequences of doing things like cleaning up the community's surroundings. As you can see, the institution is dealing with a variety of issues, including floods and a shortage of resources due to a lack of funding. So the goal of this project is to solve the community issues because those present in our community will bring us a lot of effects and this will harm our lives, so we came up with a lot of ideas on how to solve this problem, such as a clean-up drive for the community as this is also one of the reasons why there is flooding in their community, an intervention, and some tree planting activities.
</u> <br>
</h5>


<h3> <p> <p style="color:blue"> Background: </h3>
<h5> <p> <U> As part of the proposed project intervention to solve the stated issue, which is flooding in the Madrasah community, which I believe is caused by improper waste disposal, the community will be encouraged to practice cleanliness, such as the 4Rs. We can also recommend that the community restore and maintain its sewage and drainage systems. Such concerns have a high potential of triggering other problems, such as floods, that have an impact on the ecology. This might have an effect on the inhabitants' health. These proposed actions can help them achieve their goal of having a clean town with a healthy populace. To be successful, we need dedicated volunteers who take the initiative. This will take a significant amount of time and work. This project's success is dependent on teamwork. I said this because, based on my experience and learning, we need to take action for this type of problem because it has been a problem for us for a long time already, and the relevance of solving this issue to our partnered institution is that it will help people lessen their worries about the problems that they are facing in their community because these problems can affect our own living, and that is why if we want to solve it, we need to take actions already.

<h2> <p> <p style="color:blackblue"> 	The INTERVENTION</h2>

<h3> <p <p style="color:blue"> Proposed Project </h3>
<h5> <p> <u> The community will be urged to practice cleanliness, such as the 4Rs, as part of the planned project intervention to assist address the issue stated. Additionally, we can suggest that the community repair and maintain its sewage and drainage infrastructure. Such concerns have a significant likelihood of causing other problems, such as flooding, which affects the ecosystem. The health of the locals may also be impacted by this. These suggested initiatives can assist in helping them realize their aim of having a clean community and a healthy population. To succeed, we require committed volunteers who take initiative. This requires a lot of effort and time. Teamwork is the key to success on this project.
</u> <br>
</h5>


<h3> <p> <p style="color:blue"> Solution: </h3>
<h5> <p> <u> Our proposed solution is organizing a project intervention throughout the madrasah, which will give us the opportunity to reduce waste that clogs the sewage and drainage systems and to purchase recycling materials, such as bins, shovels, and sanitary materials. in order to dispose of the waste properly and repair other damages caused by the flooding. This proposal will be effective because it gives the beneficiaries a chance to be able to see the process of improving their environment, promote it to future benefactors, and educate others about their situation, which in turn will be able to fulfill our goal of aiding their issues. This solution is better compared to other alternatives because it has a more realistic outcome, is considerate of the beneficiaries, and is also a process that will guarantee their need for aid. For us to make it happen, we will need volunteers, sanitary materials, recycling, and/or repair materials. With these, we are able to do our best to help them improve their environment and learning conditions.
